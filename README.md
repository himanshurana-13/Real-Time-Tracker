## ðŸš€ Getting Started
First, install the dependencies using the command: npm install
Second, start your development server.  
Check the `package.json` file to see which script is being used.  
It will usually be one of the following: npm run dev or npm start
Third, if you want to view or test the project on your phone, you can't use `localhost` directly.  
Instead, generate a public link using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): Replace `3000` with your actual running port. ngrok will give you a public URL to open on your phone.
Finally, your project should now be running successfully! ðŸŽ‰
